> ### Note:  
> In SAP Cloud ALM for operations, email notifications are sent based on events using [Intelligent Event Processing](https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-alm/applicationhelp/intelligent-event-processing) and [Notification Management](https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-alm/applicationhelp/notification-management). These notifications aren't the subject of this page because they aren't displayed in the in-app notifications.
