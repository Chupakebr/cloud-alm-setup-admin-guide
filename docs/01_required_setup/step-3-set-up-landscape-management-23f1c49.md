# Step 3: Set Up Landscape Management

As the last step of the required setup, services and systems \(technical systems\) need to be set up in the *Landscape Management* app in SAP Cloud ALM.

To import your services or register your systems in SAP Cloud ALM, follow the steps described in the respective subchapters:
